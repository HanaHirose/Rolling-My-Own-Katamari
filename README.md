## Description
"Rolling My Own Katamari" is a tribute game inspired by the 2004 Namco release, Katamari Damacy. This recreation not only mimics the fundamental mechanics of the original but also replicates its more intricate details such as dashing, quick stopping, directional changes, camera movements, and the dynamic physics of the Katamari. The primary goal remains unchangedâ€”to increase the Katamari's size by collecting various objects throughout the game.
